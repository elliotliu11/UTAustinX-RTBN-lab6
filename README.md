# UTAustinX-RTBN-lab6
Real-Time Bluetooth Networks - Shape the World Lab6

Course content:
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.RTBN.12.01x+3T2019/course/

You can use TM4C123 or MSP432 launchpad for the course. 
The source code is for TM4C123 launchpad. The lab6 contains the contents from Lab2 and Lab3 as well. So this is a three-in-one lab.

The lab includes rtos development (Lab 2-4) and building message for ble (lab6). I recommend anyone is interested in Micro-Controller to take this course. If you are just interested in BLE, then this course may not be so interesting to you.
